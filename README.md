# Quant Finance Lab (Python + AI + Research)

This repository is a collection of high-performance quantitative finance models
developed using Python, statistical modeling, optimization theory, and machine learning.

The goal: **build institutional-grade trading & risk systems — openly, transparently, and reproducibly.**
