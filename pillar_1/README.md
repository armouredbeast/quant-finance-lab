PILLAR 1 — Probability & Mathematical Foundations

This section contains 5 foundational quant models designed to build intuition for randomness, distributions, convergence, and underlying mathematical structures used across quantitative finance.

⸻

📌 1. Probability Simulator (Coins / Dice / Bayes)

A general-purpose engine to simulate:
	•	Coin tosses
	•	Dice rolls
	•	Bayes theorem conditional probability
Includes visualization + frequency plots.

Script: 01_probability_simulator/probability_simulator.py

⸻

📌 2. Random Variable Generator

Generates:
	•	Discrete RVs (Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric)
	•	Continuous RVs (Normal, Uniform, Exponential)
Plots PMF/PDF & samples.

Script: 02_random_variable_generator/random_variable_generator.py

⸻

📌 3. Distribution Explorer

A visual tool to explore PDFs + CDFs for major distributions:
	•	Normal
	•	Exponential
	•	Uniform

Script: 03_distribution_explorer/distribution_explorer.py

⸻

📌 4. Law of Large Numbers (LLN) Simulator

Demonstrates convergence of sample mean → true mean using Monte Carlo.
Supports multiple distributions + real-time convergence plot.

Script: 04_lln_simulator/lln_simulator.py

⸻

📌 5. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Engine

Simulates sampling distribution of sample means from:
	•	Uniform
	•	Exponential
	•	Bernoulli

Overlays Gaussian curve to visualize convergence.

Script: 05_clt_engine/clt_engine.py

🟧 Educational Purpose

These foundational models help develop intuition for:
	•	Randomness
	•	Convergence
	•	Sampling distributions
	•	Basic Monte Carlo
	•	Core distribution properties

This foundation is essential for all upcoming pillars.
