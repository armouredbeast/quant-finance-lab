# PILLAR 1 — PROJECT 4  
## Law of Large Numbers (LLN) Simulator

This project visualizes one of the most important ideas in probability:  
**the sample mean converges to the true expectation as N → ∞.**

### Included Distributions
- Normal(0,1) — mean = 0  
- Uniform(0,1) — mean = 0.5  
- Exponential(λ=1) — mean = 1  

### Visual Output
For each distribution:
- Running mean curve  
- True mean line  
- Clear convergence behaviour
