# PILLAR 1 — PROJECT 2  
## Random Variable Generator

This educational model introduces the concept of **random variables** through clean sampling engines for both discrete and continuous distributions.

### Features
✔ Bernoulli(p)  
✔ Binomial(n, p)  
✔ Poisson(λ)  
✔ Uniform(a, b)  
✔ Exponential(λ)  
✔ Normal(μ, σ)  
✔ Empirical PMF / PDF plots
